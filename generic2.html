          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>
           I worked with a mental health app to help test the effectiveness of the content created for mental health courses.
          </p>
          <h2>UXR Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            By conducting a comprehensive study involving interviews, and various usability tests (Comprehensive testing, Cloze testing, A/B testing & Guerrilla Testing), I acquired valuable insights into the preferences and concerns of prospective users. This process enabled me to identify significant usability challenges within the current iteration of the app’s content. Moreover, I undertook an in-depth analysis of other competitors in mental health industry to explore effective strategies for enhancing user engagement and retention with the content. Subsequently, I formulated content recommendations based on these findings to optimize the app's content user experience and effectiveness.
          </p>
          <h2>Understanding the Product Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We conducted a small research with family friends beta testers and had following assumptions about two profile of the users:
            <br />
           - Users between 13-19 years old <br />

-- Clinical (people with mental health condition diagnosis) & non-clinical people <br />

-- Interested in self-improvement <br />

-- Mental health advocates <br />
            - Users between 35-65 years old<br />

-- Interested in helping out their teens <br /> <br />
            Before conducting UXR, I dedicated time to understanding the role early prevention (social & emotional skills) that plays an important role in preventing mental health disorders and improve one’s mental health. As a psychologist, I already had deep understanding of significance and how implementation of various therapeutic approaches in early prevention works. Therefore, along with the app’s team, two main objectives for the research were decided upon:

 <br /><br />
           - Discover the strengths and weaknesses of the current content:  <br />

-- Understand how easily users are interacting with the content <br />

-- Understand if users are understanding everything in the content section <br />

-- Understand how they feel about the content <br />

- Identify opportunities for users to stay interested and engaged <br />

-- Take feedback from users about improvements we can implement <br />
          </p>

          <h2>Interviews for comprehensive testing of content
</h2>
          <p>
          Usability testing provides insight into in what ways people are utilizing and engaging with the content. For understand more in-depth insights I recruited 2 participants for an in-depth interview. Why I choose comprehensive testing because this method is useful for creating content for different cognitive needs and abilities.   </p>
         <br />

          I asked open ended questions about: <br />

-- the meaning of therapeutic words that were used in the content <br />

-- the parts of the content that users might found difficult to understand  <br />

-- if the have understand the content and what outcome they expect from their understanding  <br />

-- if they can explain to me what they have read without looking or rereading  <br />

<h2>Cloze Testing</h2>
            <p>
              Further, I used Cloze Testing to focus on the reading  comprehension metrics of the content to avoid certain amount of jargon and technical words. I asked  participants to look at a selection of text with certain (mostly keywords) words removed and fill in the blanks. I set the rule of accepting synonyms and 75 percent accuracy. 
            </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<h2>A/B Testing </h2>
            <p>
              After we had our first impressions, we iterated to the two more newer version of the contents and then tested both of these contents to compare which user liked most, get engaged with, think are helpful for them in implementation.   </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<h2>Guerrilla Testing 
 </h2>
            <p> In addition to using various usabilitiy approaches we also decided to do Guerilla testing and tested content in the conferences and related events. To test how quickly people can comprehend the content of the app. 
           </p>
      
<h2>Recommendations 
 </h2>
            <p> After conducting in-depth interviews and usability tests, I proposed following changes: <br />

- Removing and replacing of various technical words <br />

<h2>Impact
 </h2>
            <p> This track of UXR has left a strong legacy, and a comprehensive playbook for the company to leverage on to well-researched improvement suggestions for content optimization </p>
