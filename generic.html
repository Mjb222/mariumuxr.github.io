              UX Research, Competitive Analysis & Journey Mapping of Performance
              Boosting app for Athletes
            </h3>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              My Role: User Researcher <br />
              Methods: Desk Research <br />
              Interview & Journey Mapping Tools: Canva, Otter, pen & paper
              <br />
              Duration: Aug2023-Present<br />
            </p>
          </header>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/ux3.png" alt="" /></div>
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>
            A start-up called Boosters approached me to learn more about their
            prospective users, to do competitive analysis, and to design user
            journey mapping for their performance boosting app for young
            athletes.
          </p>
          <h2>UXR Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            By conducting a comprehensive study involving surveys and
            interviews, I acquired valuable insights into the preferences and
            concerns of prospective users. This process enabled me to identify
            significant challenges of young athletes. Moreover, I undertook an
            in-depth analysis of other competitors in the wellness industry to
            explore effective strategies to make the app standout and unique
            from competitors. Subsequently, I design the user journey mapping
            for the MVP and recommended features that would help the app to
            provide value proposition unique from competitors out in the market.
          </p>
          <h2>Understanding the Product Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Booster app’s researchers had conducted a small research with some
            athletes and had following assumptions about their users:
            <br />
            - Users between 13-23 years old <br />
            - Interested in performance increase <br />
            Before conducting UXR, I dedicated time to understanding the
            stresses that young athletes go through in terms of performance,
            balancing studies, social and peer pressures. As a psychologist with
            background in sports psychology, I already had deep understanding of
            wellness challenges that athletes face in terms of performance.
            Therefore, along with Booster’s app’s team, three main objectives
            for the research were decided upon: <br />
            - Doing Competitive Analysis <br />
            - Field Interviews and talk to the users (athletes) to learn more
            about athletes and their day to day challenges and pressures they go
            through. <br />
            --- Identify opportunities for users by asking them what solutions
            they are utilizing to boost their performance and increase their
            overall wellness. <br />
            --- How they deal with day to day challenges of balancing sports,
            study, social circle, family time.
          </p>
          <h2>Competitive Landscape: Understanding & Insights</h2>
          <p>
            To develop a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape, I
            conducted a competitor analysis. I compared “Champion’s Mind” and
            “Mindset” as Flow app indicated these two apps as their main
            competitors.<br />
            During my desk research, I examined that these both apps had good
            user retention as per rating on the app stores. Thus, i focused on
            examining their user retention and engagement strategy to understand
            their value proposition. I also looked at wellness athletes’
            communities, feedback on app store, and blogs on the respective
            competitor apps to understand pain points of users and design
            opportunities for MVP.
          </p>
          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            During competitive analysis, I identified following strategies for
            user engagement, retention, and app optimization: <br />
            - Onboarding process explanation for great first time user
            experience <br />
            - Daily encouragement notifications <br />
            - Gaming aspect- Streaks <br />
            - Awards for achieving a certain task <br />
            - Encouragement after tasks completion <br />
            - Community engagement <br />
            - In-app feedback option
          </p>
          <h2>Interview</h2>
          <p>
            For understand more in-depth insights I recruited 4 participants for
            an in-depth interview. Major focus of the interview was on the
            following points: <br />- To learn more about athletes and their day
            to day challenges and pressures they go through. <br />
            - Identify opportunities for users by asking them what solutions
            they are utilizing to boost their performance and increase their
            overall wellness. <br />
            - How they deal with day to day challenges of balancing sports,
            study, social circle, family time.
          </p>
          <h2>User Journery Mapping</h2>
          <p>
            After conducting a thorough research and according to my findings, I
            proposed following design of user journey mapping. Creating user
            journey maps helped us to visualize the user's interactions with the
            prospective MVP, highlighting pain points and opportunities for
            improvement.
          </p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="images/cus.jpg" alt="" /></div>

          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>
            I also recommended following value propositions for MVP
            Personalization: <br />
            - Incorporate AI-driven personalization to adapt training plans
            based on progress and feedback. <br />
            - Gamification: Integrate interactive challenges, leaderboards, and
            rewards to enhance motivation. <br />
            - Real-time Feedback: Implement immediate feedback mechanisms during
            exercises to optimize performance. <br />
            - Social Integration: Enable users to connect, share, and compete
            with friends for a sense of community. <br />
            - Clean Interface: Design an intuitive, easy-to-navigate UI that
            caters to varying user preferences.
          </p>
          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            This track of Agile UXR has left a strong legacy, and a
            comprehensive playbook for the company to leverage to build their
            MVP on.
